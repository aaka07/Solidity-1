MyToken Smart Contract - README
This README provides a detailed explanation of the MyToken smart contract. The contract is a simple implementation of a token with basic functionalities such as minting and burning tokens. It adheres to the MIT license.

Overview
The MyToken contract is designed to:

Store details about the token.
Manage balances of token holders using a mapping.
Allow minting of tokens to increase total supply and the balance of a given address.
Allow burning of tokens to decrease total supply and the balance of a given address, with proper checks to ensure sufficient balance.
Features
Public Variables
name: Stores the name of the token, defaulted to "MyToken".
symbol: Stores the token's abbreviation, defaulted to "MTK".
totalSupply: Tracks the total supply of the token.
Mapping
balances: A mapping that links each address to its corresponding balance of tokens.
Functions
1. mint(address _to, uint256 _value)
Purpose: Increases the total supply of tokens and the balance of a specified address.
Parameters:
_to: The address to receive the minted tokens.
_value: The amount of tokens to mint.
Logic:
Increases totalSupply by _value.
Adds _value to the balance of _to.
2. burn(address _from, uint256 _value)
Purpose: Decreases the total supply of tokens and the balance of a specified address.
Parameters:
_from: The address whose tokens are to be burned.
_value: The amount of tokens to burn.
Logic:
Requires the balance of _from to be greater than or equal to _value.
Decreases totalSupply by _value.
Deducts _value from the balance of _from.
Contract Flow
Minting Tokens:

Call the mint function with the recipient address and the amount to mint.
This increases both the totalSupply and the recipientâ€™s balance.
Burning Tokens:

Call the burn function with the address and the amount to burn.
The contract ensures the address has enough tokens before proceeding.
Reduces both the totalSupply and the balance of the specified address.
Example Usage
Deploying the Contract
Deploy the contract using any Ethereum-compatible development environment (e.g., Remix, Hardhat).
Minting Tokens
Call mint:
solidity
Copy code
mint(0xYourAddress, 100);
This adds 100 tokens to the balance of 0xYourAddress and increases the total supply by 100.
Burning Tokens
Call burn:
solidity
Copy code
burn(0xYourAddress, 50);
This reduces the balance of 0xYourAddress by 50 and decreases the total supply by 50.
Requirements and Limitations
Mint Function:

There are no restrictions on who can call the mint function. To add security, consider implementing role-based access control (e.g., only an admin can mint tokens).
Burn Function:

Ensures that the address burning tokens has a sufficient balance.
Token Properties:

The token does not follow the ERC-20 standard and is for learning or demonstration purposes.
Enhancements
Implement access control for minting and burning tokens.
Add events to track mint and burn operations.
Extend functionality to comply with the ERC-20 standard.
